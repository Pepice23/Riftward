# Riftward - Project Plan

**Title:** Riftward  
**Created:** November 15, 2025  
**Status:** Planning / Pre-Development

---

## Core Identity

**Genre:** Vampire Survivors-style auto-battler with high fantasy theme

**Visual Style:**
- Stylized, cartoony aesthetic (WoW-inspired)
- Bright and colorful (NOT dark/grimdark)
- AI-generated assets using Flux model in SwarmUI
- 2D illustrated style OR low-poly 3D (NOT pixel art)

**Gameplay Philosophy:**
- Accessible progression (not reflex-heavy)
- Focus on build choices over twitch reactions
- "One more run" loop with satisfying progression
- Run-based structure with meta progression

---

## What Makes This Mine

This is the fantasy VS-like I would want to play:
- Uses the high fantasy aesthetic I already love
- Features distinct classes with unique abilities
- Bright, fun tone instead of horror/gothic
- Scratches my personal itch for this genre

**Personal motivation:** Building what I'd enjoy playing and creating, not trying to prove something or chase trends.

---

## What We're NOT Doing

**Explicit scope boundaries:**
- âŒ Pixel art (it's exhausting for me)
- âŒ Dark/horror themes
- âŒ Overly complex economy systems
- âŒ Trying to be revolutionary - just making something fun and solid
- âŒ Starting without a plan

## Technical Approach

**Engine:** Godot 4.5 with C# (.NET)

**Why C#:**
- Language familiarity and structure help me understand what I'm building
- Better tooling (VS Code, Rider)
- Strong typing keeps me from getting lost as complexity grows
- Access to .NET ecosystem
- I can reach 90%+ code confidence instead of 70%

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build to understand, not just to finish
- Prioritize visible progress (health bars > bugfixes for motivation)
- Small daily wins
- Ask for help when stuck, but understand the solutions

---

## Core Game Loop (To Define)

**Basic Run Structure:**
- Player controls a character (class-based)
- Enemies spawn in waves
- Auto-attacking with abilities
- Level up â†’ choose upgrades
- Run ends after X minutes or death
- Meta progression unlocks between runs

**Classes (To Design):**
Starting with 3-4 distinct classes:
- Ideas: Mage, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue?
- Each with signature abilities and upgrade paths
- WoW-style fantasy archetypes

**Upgrade System:**
- Level up â†’ choose 1 of 3 upgrades
- Simple talent-tree style choices
- Class-specific upgrade pools
- Not building one massive system - small focused trees per class

**Meta Progression:**
- Unlock new classes?
- Permanent stat boosts?
- New starting abilities?
- (To define based on what keeps runs fresh)

## Day 1 Goals (When Ready)

**Planning Day 1:**
- âœ… Define core identity (DONE)
- âœ… Establish scope boundaries (DONE)
- Define 3-4 starting classes
- Sketch basic run structure
- List meta progression ideas

**Working Day 1:**
- Install Godot 4.5 with .NET support
- Create new C# project
- Make a character sprite move with keyboard input
- See it work on screen

**One visible win to start.**

---

## Development Principles

1. **Understanding over speed** - Build slower but comprehend every piece
2. **Visible progress** - Structure work to see results frequently
3. **No AI dependency** - Use AI for lookup/translation, not to outsource thinking
4. **Sustainable pace** - Rest when tired, don't push through burnout
5. **Personal connection** - Keep the "why I want this" visible

---

## Next Steps (When Ready)

- Set up project folder
- Collect reference images (fantasy art, WoW screenshots, VS-like gameplay)
- Design starting classes (3-4 to begin)
- Define core upgrade types
- Sketch meta progression system
- Install Godot and start Day 1 Working

## Notes to Self

- This is about making something I'd enjoy, not proving I'm "production ready"
- The Zafi game worked because it had personal meaning
- The Tower got boring when it became about checking boxes
- C#'s structure helps me understand better than GDScript's flexibility
- I have the skills - I need the plan and the personal connection
- Monday start is nice, not mandatory
- Rest is productive too

**Remember:** Small wins compound. Build something you understand. Make what you'd want to play.
