Riftward - Roadmap to "Done"
Vision: A satisfying 10-minute run where the player gets strong enough to defeat a boss that spawns at the end.

Core Loop

Regular enemies spawn continuously
Elite packs spawn every 90 seconds
Boss spawns at 10-minute mark
Victory = Kill the boss
Defeat = Boss kills you

Phase 1: Polish the Core Loop
Goal: Make the moment-to-moment gameplay feel good

Add 5-8 more upgrades per class (variety = replayability)
Balance enemy health/damage for satisfying combat
Balance upgrade power so choices matter
Test difficulty curve (enemies get harder, but so do you)

Phase 2: The Boss Fight
Goal: Create a climactic finale

Design boss enemy (extra beefy + simple attack pattern)
Boss spawns at 05:00
Implement victory condition (kill boss)
Implement defeat condition (boss kills player)
Test: Can the player actually win with good upgrades?

Phase 3: Polish & Wrap
Goal: Make it feel complete

Victory screen (you won!)
Defeat screen (you died!)
Optional: Stats screen (enemies killed, time survived, level reached)
Final balance pass - does the full 10-minute run feel good?

Future/Optional (Post-"Done")

Meta progression (talent trees for permanent unlocks)
More enemy types with different behaviors
More complex boss mechanics
Class-specific abilities beyond starting weapons
Whatever else sounds fun

Development Philosophy

Work on what excites you that day
All phases feed into each other - bouncing between them is fine
Don't start completely new systems before finishing pieces of what's there
"Done" = one satisfying 10-minute run, not perfection

Current Status: Foundation complete (3 classes, upgrade system, spawning, XP/leveling)
